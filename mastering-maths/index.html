                Mathematics is a fundamental part of human thought and logic,
                and integral to attempts at understanding the world and us.
                Mathematics provides an effective way of building mental
                discipline and encourages logical reasoning and mental rigor. In
                addition, mathematical knowledge plays a crucial role in
                understanding the contents of other school subjects such as
                science, social studies, and even music and art.
              </p>
              <p class="col-lg-10" data-aos="fade-up">
                A child’s math knowledge at the start of kindergarten predicts
                later academic achievement better than early reading or
                attention skills. Mathematics provides foundational knowledge
                and skills for other school subjects, such as sciences, art,
                economy, etc. and the Mathematical concepts and procedures are
                used to solve problems in science, engineering, economics.
              </p>
              <p class="col-lg-11" data-aos="fade-up">
                As early as the 1st grade, students can start displaying
                negative attitudes towards learning Mathematics and gradually
                develop it in the form of mathematics anxiety. Students’
                performance in Mathematics tends to decrease gradually as the
                students move to the upper grades.
              </p>
              <p class="col-lg-11" data-aos="fade-up">
                Mathematics phobia is mainly caused by the exam fear (to perform
                well), pressure from people (parents, teachers, and peers),
                parents’ perceived difficulty, teachers’ poor knowledge delivery
                and peers negative feeling and the abstract nature of
                Mathematics and difficulty in relating to all aspects in real
                life.
              </p>
              <p class="col-lg-11" data-aos="fade-up">
                The fear of math stems from the idea where students are expected
                to calculate the expected outcome of a mathematical problem.
                They become uncomfortable if they cannot calculate the value of
                their next step right away. In addition, when they cannot
                understand the formula which is used to solve a mathematical
                problem, they will be terrified to use that formula again. When
                someone experiences severe anxiety due to the inability to
                predict their next result, it is likely that they will develop a
                phobia of math in their entire life.

            The “Maths is for boys” stereotype has been used as part of the
            explanation for why so few women pursue science, Mathematics, and
            engineering careers. The cultural stereotype may nudge girls to
            think that “math is not for me,” which can affect what activities
            they engage in and their career aspirations.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The new study, published in the March/April issue of Child
            Development, suggests that for girls, lack of interest in
            mathematics may come from culturally communicated messages about
            math being more appropriate for boys than for girls, the researchers
            said.

                  geo-boards and pattern blocks), hands-on learning helps

            A new large-scale study confirms what most principals and teachers
            have long believed. Active learning experiences using manipulatives
            appear to function as learning anchors that organize and integrate
            classroom learning, helping make aspects of what students need to
            learn more visible than abstract, conceptual instruction.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            A substantial majority (90 per cent) said that hands-on projects
            help students understand basic ideas, and 82 percent said that
            handcrafted projects help their students apply information in new
            situations.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            85 percent of the teachers also agreed that long-term hands-on
            projects give students a greater depth of understanding than more
            conventional instructional methods.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            While 46 percent of teachers viewed hands-on projects as an
            effective learning technique for all students, 54 percent said that
            this approach is particularly well-suited for students who learn
            more effectively in non-traditional approaches, particularly visual
            or kinesthetic learners, slow readers, and students with limited
            English-language skills.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The teachers noted significant differences in learning behaviors
            when students are involved in hands-on projects. They reported
            increases in student motivation, willingness to ask questions and
            volunteer information, enthusiasm, and attention to assigned tasks.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Hands-on educational experiences move students beyond the
            traditional and passive practices of teaching and learning by
            incorporating creation, expression, and the presentation of ideas.
            Spectacular results can be achieved when learning is taken off the
            chalkboard and literally put into the hands of the learners
            themselves.

                  Mathematics is a subject that relies on memorization of facts

            To combine the real world with Maths curriculum is called “hands on”
            learning. When students can correlate new concepts from the
            curriculum with real-world concepts, their brains are stimulated and
            retained for long term memory. It means using tactile objects that
            your child can touch and feel, linking up neurological pathways in
            the brain to create better understanding, retention, and memory. It
            also helps with focus for students with short attention spans or
            other learning difficulties.Hands on learning helps develop critical
            thinking and analytical skills which will continue to be beneficial
            throughout their life.

            These are the skills imperative to further success in life,
            including study options, entrepreneurship, and career choices. More
            importantly, hands on learning adds fun to the lessons for both the
            teacher and the student.By adding hands on activities and using
            multi-sensory manipulatives, Teachers can engage students much more
            easily and teach them Maths skills that they will remember for
            life.Research has proven that students who are taught using hands-on
            teaching methods with manipulatives outperform those who are
            not.Math is often thought of as a subject that relies on
            memorization of facts and practicing skills, but the true test of
            success in mathematics comes when a student must figure out an
            answer but can’t remember a fact or has forgotten a skill. Hands-on
            learning drives authentic understanding and application versus
            memorization algorithms, or “tricks.” Students who use manipulatives
            create physical evidence of thinking and reasoning, solve problems,
            and make sense of mathematical ideas.

            Math manipulatives are small objects that help with teaching math.
            They are useful tools for teachers and students. Manipulatives are
            physical teaching tools which engage students not just visually, but
            also physically. Using them was more enjoyable than doing
            mathematics that was solely abstract and symbolic.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            They provide a hands-on way in which to explore and learn. When
            children are using these materials in natural ways, they are
            learning differently than they are when they are only listening or
            watching a lesson. This tactile learning builds a more profound,
            personal understanding of math concepts.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            By touching and exploring hands-on materials, children use their
            senses, which allows more cognitive connections to be made with a
            concept. Students are often lost in a muddle of symbols and numbers.
            For that reason, they need something concrete to understand
            difficult and complex math concepts.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Manipulatives serve as a bridge between concrete and abstract levels
            of complicated mathematical topics. Students were active, engaged
            and interested in lessons when manipulative.

            Math manipulatives make it a lot more fun! Children of all ages
            enjoy using these concrete tools to make sense of the problems they
            are given. They mainly help younger learners who are learning new
            math concepts for the first time.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            A relationship is built when children see how to solve problems and
            given opportunities to “try” something using math manipulatives.
            With repeated practice and “play” with manipulatives, math fluency
            develops.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The use of manipulatives can be very powerful in explaining the
            meaning and justifying the use of different mathematical processes
            such as compact algorithms. By asking learners to use manipulatives
            to demonstrate results and prove their truth in some sense, it will
            develop the mathematical thinking at the deep level required to
            support the conceptual understanding.
